## 2026-03-05 - [Path Traversal in HybridDocumentStore]
**Vulnerability:** Path Traversal via unvalidated `collectionName` and `documentId` in `HybridDocumentStore.cs` allowing reads/writes outside the intended base directory.
**Learning:** Even though `collectionName` was partially validated, `documentId` was concatenated directly using `Path.Combine` without checking if the resulting path escaped the base directory. This allowed directory traversal attacks via malicious IDs like `../../sensitive_file`.
**Prevention:** Always use `PathValidator.GetSafePath` when constructing file paths from user inputs to ensure the resulting path remains within the allowed base directory.
