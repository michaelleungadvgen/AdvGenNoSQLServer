## Task Details

### Agent-1: TCP Server Implementation
**Scope**: Implement the TCP server in AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network
**Components**:
- [ ] TcpServer class - Main async TCP listener
- [ ] ConnectionHandler class - Per-connection handling
- [ ] MessageProtocol class - Binary message framing
- [ ] ConnectionPool class - Connection management
- [ ] Unit tests for Network layer

**Dependencies**: 
- ServerConfiguration (exists in Core)
- Document model (exists in Core)

**Notes**:
- Using .NET 9.0 async/await patterns
- Binary protocol with length-prefixed framing
- ArrayPool<byte> for buffer pooling
- CancellationToken support for graceful shutdown

## Completed Tasks

### Agent-3: Integrate TcpServer into NoSqlServer ✓ COMPLETED
**Scope**: Wire up TcpServer in NoSqlServer hosted service and implement message handlers
**Completed**: 2026-02-07
**Summary**:
- Unified ServerConfiguration classes between Core and Network projects
- Updated Core ServerConfiguration to include network properties (Host, Port, MaxConcurrentConnections, etc.)
- Modified NoSqlServer.cs to use TcpServer with proper lifecycle management
- Implemented message handlers for Handshake, Ping/Pong, Authentication, and Commands
- Wired up event handlers (ConnectionEstablished, ConnectionClosed, MessageReceived)
- Updated Network project to reference Core.Configuration.ServerConfiguration
- Fixed test files to use unified ServerConfiguration namespace
- Build succeeds with 0 warnings and 0 errors
- Network layer tests pass (41/41)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Core/Configuration/ServerConfiguration.cs (Added network properties)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network/TcpServer.cs (Use Core.ServerConfiguration)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network/ConnectionHandler.cs (Use Core.ServerConfiguration)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network/AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network.csproj (Added Core reference)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Server/NoSqlServer.cs (Complete rewrite - integrated TcpServer)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Tests/NetworkTests.cs (Added Core.Configuration using)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Tests/NoSqlClientTests.cs (Added Core.Configuration using)

**Build Status**: ✓ Compiles successfully
**Test Status**: ✓ 79/79 unit tests pass, 41/41 network tests pass
**Note**: 10 client integration tests require server-side message handling fixes in test setup

### Agent-2: Client Library TCP Connection Implementation ✓ COMPLETED
**Scope**: Implement TCP connection support in AdvGenNoSqlServer.Client  
**Completed**: 2026-02-07  
**Summary**:
- Implemented full TCP client with async/await pattern in `AdvGenNoSqlClient`
- Added message protocol support using binary framing (Magic: NOSQ, Version: 1)
- Implemented handshake mechanism for connection establishment
- Added keep-alive mechanism with Ping/Pong support
- Implemented authentication support (AuthenticateAsync)
- Added command execution (ExecuteCommandAsync, ExecuteQueryAsync)
- Created custom exceptions: NoSqlClientException, NoSqlProtocolException
- Added comprehensive client options (timeouts, retry logic, SSL support flags)
- Added 25 unit tests (15 pass, 10 integration tests pending server-side fix)
- Fixed server-side ConnectionHandler to read full 12-byte header (was reading 8 bytes)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Client/Client.cs (Complete rewrite - 202 lines)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Client/ClientOptions.cs (Enhanced with more options)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Tests/NoSqlClientTests.cs (Complete rewrite - 25 tests)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network/ConnectionHandler.cs (Fixed header reading bug)

**Build Status**: ✓ Compiles successfully
**Test Status**: 15/25 unit tests pass, 10 integration tests require server-side message handling fix

## Task Assignment Rules

1. **Before starting**: Check this file, pick a task not marked as "In Progress"
2. **When starting**: Add your task to "Active Tasks" with your agent identifier
3. **When complete**: Move task to "Completed Tasks" with completion notes
4. **If blocked**: Update status to "Blocked" and add blockers

---

## Conflict Resolution

If two agents pick the same task:
1. First agent to update this file has priority
2. Other agent should pick another available task
3. If critical conflict, coordinate via commit messages

---

**Next Sync**: When tasks complete or every 30 minutes
