## Task Assignment Rules

1. **Before starting**: Check this file, pick a task not marked as "In Progress"
2. **When starting**: Add your task to "Active Tasks" with your agent identifier
3. **When complete**: Move task to "Completed Tasks" with completion notes
4. **If blocked**: Update status to "Blocked" and add blockers

---

## Conflict Resolution

If two agents pick the same task:
1. First agent to update this file has priority
2. Other agent should pick another available task
3. If critical conflict, coordinate via commit messages

---

**Next Sync**: When tasks complete or every 30 minutes
