### Agent-22: Fix Integration Tests (server-side message handling) ✓ COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks

### Agent-22: Fix Integration Tests (server-side message handling) ✓ COMPLETED
**Scope**: Fix the 10 failing integration tests in NoSqlClientTests by addressing server-side message handling issues
**Completed**: 2026-02-07
**Summary**:
- Fixed ArrayPool.Return bug in ConnectionHandler.ReadMessageAsync - was incorrectly returning arrays from ReadExactAsync which returns copied arrays, not pooled ones
- Fixed ConnectionHandler.SendAsync to only write actual message length using `data.AsMemory(0, actualLength)` instead of entire rented buffer (ArrayPool.Rent returns larger buffers than requested)
- Added TaskCompletionSource pattern in MessageReceivedEventArgs for proper async event handler synchronization
- Modified ProcessConnectionLoopAsync to await response before reading next message
- Fixed NoSqlServer.HandlePingAsync to return MessageType.Pong instead of MessageType.Response (client expects Pong)
- All 25 client integration tests now pass (was 15 passing, 10 failing)

**Root Causes Fixed**:
1. ArrayPool.Return on non-pooled arrays caused "buffer is not associated with this pool" errors
2. WriteAsync sending entire rented buffer (including garbage bytes) corrupted protocol stream
3. Event handler not awaited before reading next message caused race conditions
4. Ping handler returning wrong message type caused client PingAsync to fail

**Files Modified**:
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network/ConnectionHandler.cs (removed incorrect ArrayPool.Return calls, fixed WriteAsync)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Network/TcpServer.cs (added TaskCompletionSource pattern for async event handling)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Server/NoSqlServer.cs (fixed HandlePingAsync to return Pong message type)
- AdvGenNoSqlServer.Client/Client.cs (minor cleanup)

**Build Status**: ✓ Compiles successfully (0 errors, 0 warnings from new code)
**Test Status**: ✓ 25/25 client integration tests pass
